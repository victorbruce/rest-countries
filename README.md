## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is built using Angular, SCSS, Typescript and hosted on Netlify.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Angular
- RxJS
- Jasmine & Karma(test runner)
- Typescript
- SCSS

## 📦 Installing

Clone the repository and run the command:

```sh
git clone <project>
cd <project>
```

## 💻 Running the Application

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

### Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

### Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

**NB:** Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
